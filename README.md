* Simulator. You can download these from the [project intro page](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases) in the classroom.

Fellow students have put together a guide to Windows set-up for the project [here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/files/Kidnapped_Vehicle_Windows_Setup.pdf) if the environment you have set up for the Sensor Fusion projects does not work for this project. There's also an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3).

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./

# Demo

![PID controlled car](video/pid-short-compressed.gif)

## How is a PID controller working?

In this project we use a PID controller to controll the steering angle of the car based on the cross track error (cte). A PID controller consists of three different parameter which have different influence on the result. The goal is to controll the steering angle of the car in a way so that the car stays as close to the center of the road as possible. Therefore the cte is simply the offset of the car to the lane centerline.

**P** - The proportional part of the PID controller. This part is used to immediately counteract the instantanious error. This component acts, as the name implys, proportional to the error. In our case this means, the larger the cte the steeper the resulting steering angle.

**I** - The integral part of the PID controller. In contrary to the P component the I part is not calculated based on the cross track error but the sum (integral) of the cte over the last n steps. This helps to counteract systematic errors introduces for example by a constant drift.

**D** - The differential part of the PID controller. This component acts based on the differential of (cte - prev_cte). Without this part or when only using the P component the car never reaches a stable state around the centerline but oscillates around it. In the simulation case the car even never gets into a "stable" oscillating state but starts to overshoot more and more. It therefore smoothes the output of the controller and lowers the steering angle when the car gets closer to the centerline. It therefore smoothes the car's trajectory.

## How are parameters tuned?

The paramters are only tweaked by hand. I started with increasing the P parameter while keaping I and D to 0.0. With only a P-controller the car can stay on track only for a little while until it starts to overshoot the centerline pretty heavily. I increased the P part up to 0.5. After that I started increase D. After adding D the car can stay on track pretty well. Just by visual inspecting the car drove the smoothest with a D-value of 4.0. Increasing this value more and more leads to a car which stays more closer to centerline, but with the downside of being very slow since the steering angle toggles in every step between two large values. In the end I also added a very small I-value of 0.002. Visually I could not see any improvements but this factor should counteract any longterm drifts of the car.
